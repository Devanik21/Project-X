It's a trial-and-error process, much like how humans or animals learn through interaction and feedback.\n\n2.  **Core Concepts of an RL System:**\n    *   **Agent**: This is the learner or decision-maker. The agent observes the environment, makes decisions (chooses actions), and learns from the consequences of those actions.\n    *   **Environment**: This encompasses everything outside the agent with which the agent interacts. It defines the context in which the agent operates and responds to the agent's actions by presenting new states and providing rewards.\n    *   **State (S)**: A state represents a complete description of the environment at a particular moment in time. It provides all necessary information for the agent to make an informed decision about what action to take next.\n    *   **Action (A)**: An action is a move or decision made by the agent within the environment. The set of available actions can vary depending on the current state.\n    *   **Reward (R)**: A reward is a numerical feedback signal given by the environment to the agent after it performs an action in a given state. A positive reward encourages the agent to repeat the action, while a negative reward (penalty) discourages it. The immediate reward signals the desirability of an action.\n\n3.  **Typical RL Problem Setup:**\n    In a typical RL problem, the agent begins by observing the current `state` of the environment. Based on this observation, the agent selects an `action` to perform. After executing the action, the environment transitions to a new `state` and provides a `reward` signal back to the agent. This cycle of observation, action, new state, and reward continues, allowing the agent to continuously learn and refine its behavior.\n\n4.  **Goal of an RL Agent:**\n    The ultimate goal of an RL agent is to learn an optimal `policy`. A policy (often denoted as π) is a strategy that the agent uses to decide what action to take in each state. The optimal policy is one that maximizes the total cumulative (summed over time, often discounted) reward the agent receives over the long run. This means the agent aims not just for immediate rewards, but for a sequence of actions that leads to the greatest long-term gain.","metadata":{"id":"ee684210"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)\n\n### Subtask:\nDetail the mathematical framework of MDPs, including states, actions, transition probabilities, and reward functions.

They are fundamental to reinforcement learning, allowing us to formally describe an environment in which an agent operates.\n\nAn MDP is formally defined by five key components, often represented as a tuple $(S, A, P, R, \\gamma)$:\n\n1.  **States (S)**: A finite set of possible states the agent can be in. Each state represents a specific configuration or situation of the environment.\n\n2.  **Actions (A)**: A finite set of actions available to the agent. At each state, the agent chooses an action from this set. In some cases, actions might be state-dependent, meaning $A_s$ is the set of actions available in state $s$.\n\n3.  **Transition Probability Function (P)**: Also known as the transition model, $P(s' | s, a)$ is the probability of transitioning to state $s'$ from state $s$ after taking action $a$. This function captures the stochastic nature of the environment.\n\n4.  **Reward Function (R)**: $R(s, a, s')$ (or sometimes $R(s, a)$ or $R(s')$) defines the immediate reward an agent receives after transitioning from state $s$ to state $s'$ by taking action $a$. The goal of the agent is typically to maximize the cumulative reward over time.\n\n5.  **Discount Factor (\\gamma)**: A value between 0 and 1 (inclusive), $\\gamma \\in [0, 1]$. The discount factor determines the present value of future rewards. A $\\gamma$ close to 0 makes the agent short-sighted, only caring about immediate rewards, while a $\\gamma$ close to 1 makes the agent consider future rewards more heavily.\n\n### Simple Example: A 2x2 Grid World\n\nConsider a simple 2x2 grid world where an agent wants to reach a goal. The grid has a starting cell, a goal cell, and an obstacle cell.\n\n| Start |   |\n|-------|---|\n| Obstacle | Goal |\n\nLet's define the MDP components for this scenario:\n\n*   **States (S)**: The cells in the grid. Let's label them as `(row, col)`:\n    *   $S = \\{ (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) \\}$\n    *   $(0,0)$ = Start\n    *   $(0,1)$ = Empty cell\n    *   $(1,0)$ = Obstacle\n    *   $(1,1)$ = Goal\n\n*   **Actions (A)**: The agent can move in four directions:\n    *   $A = \\{ \\text{Up, Down, Left, Right} \\}$\n\n*   **Transition Probability Function (P)**: For simplicity, assume deterministic transitions. If the agent takes an action, it moves to the intended cell with probability 1, unless it hits a wall or the obstacle. If it tries to move into an obstacle or outside the grid, it stays in its current state.\n    *   Example: $P((0,1) | (0,0), \\text{Right}) = 1$\n    *   Example: $P((0,0) | (0,0), \\text{Left}) = 1$ (hits wall)\n    *   Example: $P((0,0) | (1,0), \\text{Up}) = 1$ (tries to move from obstacle, stays in obstacle)\n    *   When the agent reaches the Goal state (1,1), it stays there for all future actions (absorbing state).\n\n*   **Reward Function (R)**: The agent receives rewards based on its transitions:\n    *   $R(s, a, (1,1)) = +10$ if the agent reaches the Goal state.\n    *   $R(s, a, (1,0)) = -5$ if the agent moves into the Obstacle state (or tries to move from it).\n    *   $R(s, a, s') = -1$ for any other transition (cost of movement).\n\n*   **Discount Factor (\\gamma)**: Let's choose $\\gamma = 0.9$ to encourage the agent to reach the goal sooner rather than later, but still consider future rewards.","metadata":{"id":"b597ce44"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Value Functions and Bellman Equations\n\n### Subtask:\nIntroduce state-value functions (V-value) and action-value functions (Q-value).

These functions are crucial for planning and learning in sequential decision-making problems.\n\n### State-Value Function ($V_{\\pi}(s)$)\n\nThe **state-value function**, denoted as $V_{\\pi}(s)$, represents the expected cumulative discounted reward an agent can expect to receive starting from state $s$ and following a specific policy $\\pi$ thereafter. A policy $\\pi$ is a mapping from states to probabilities of selecting each possible action.

These equations are recursive and form the basis for many RL algorithms.\n\n#### Bellman Expectation Equation for $V_{\\pi}(s)$\n\nThe state-value function $V_{\\pi}(s)$ can be decomposed into the immediate reward plus the discounted expected value of the next state:\n\n$$V_{\\pi}(s) = \\sum_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\pi(a|s) \\sum_{s' \\in \\mathcal{S}, r \\in \\mathcal{R}} p(s', r | s, a) [r + \\gamma V_{\\pi}(s')]$$\n\n**Explanation:**\n*   The outer sum iterates over all possible actions $a$ that can be taken from state $s$, weighted by their probabilities under policy $\\pi$ (i.e., $\\pi(a|s)$). This is because the agent follows policy $\\pi$ to choose an action.\n*   The inner sum iterates over all possible next states $s'$ and rewards $r$ that can result from taking action $a$ in state $s$, weighted by the transition probability $p(s', r | s, a)$.\n*   The term $[r + \\gamma V_{\\pi}(s')]$ represents the immediate reward $r$ obtained from the transition plus the discounted value of the next state $s'$, assuming we continue to follow policy $\\pi$.\n\nThis equation means that the value of a state $s$ is the expected sum of the immediate reward and the discounted value of the next state, averaged over all possible actions chosen by policy $\\pi$ and all possible next states and rewards generated by the environment.\n\n#### Bellman Expectation Equation for $Q_{\\pi}(s, a)$\n\nSimilarly, the action-value function $Q_{\\pi}(s, a)$ can be expressed recursively:\n\n$$Q_{\\pi}(s, a) = \\sum_{s' \\in \\mathcal{S}, r \\in \\mathcal{R}} p(s', r | s, a) [r + \\gamma \\sum_{a' \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\pi(a'|s') Q_{\\pi}(s', a')]$$\n\n**Explanation:**\n*   Starting in state $s$ and taking action $a$, the agent transitions to a next state $s'$ and receives reward $r$ with probability $p(s', r | s, a)$.\n*   From the next state $s'$, the agent then chooses an action $a'$ according to policy $\\pi$ (i.e., $\\pi(a'|s')$), leading to the action-value $Q_{\\pi}(s', a')$.\n*   The equation states that $Q_{\\pi}(s, a)$ is the expected immediate reward $r$ plus the discounted expected action-value of the next state-action pair $(s', a')$, averaged over all possible next states $s'$ and rewards $r$ given the current action $a$, and then over all possible next actions $a'$ chosen by policy $\\pi$.\n\nAlternatively, we can express $Q_{\\pi}(s,a)$ in terms of $V_{\\pi}(s')$:\n\n$$Q_{\\pi}(s, a) = \\sum_{s',r} p(s',r|s,a)[r + \\gamma V_{\\pi}(s')]$$\n\nAnd $V_{\\pi}(s)$ in terms of $Q_{\\pi}(s,a)$:\n\n$$V_{\\pi}(s) = \\sum_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\pi(a|s) Q_{\\pi}(s, a)$$\n\nThese two relationships allow us to move between state-value and action-value functions under a given policy.\n\n### Bellman Equations for Optimality\n\nWhile the expectation equations describe the value functions for a *given* policy $\\pi$, the **Bellman optimality equations** describe the value functions for the *optimal* policy, denoted as $\\pi^*$. The optimal policy is one that yields the maximum possible expected return from any state. The optimal value functions are denoted as $V^*(s)$ and $Q^*(s, a)$.\n\n#### Optimal State-Value Function ($V^*(s)$)\n\nThe optimal state-value function $V^*(s)$ is the maximum value function over all policies:\n\n$$V^*(s) = \\max_{\\pi} V_{\\pi}(s)$$\n\nThe Bellman optimality equation for $V^*(s)$ states that the value of an optimal state is the maximum over all actions of the expected return from taking that action:\n\n$$V^*(s) = \\max_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\sum_{s' \\in \\mathcal{S}, r \\in \\mathcal{R}} p(s', r | s, a) [r + \\gamma V^*(s')]$$\n\n**Explanation:**\n*   Unlike the expectation equation, which averages over actions according to a policy $\\pi(a|s)$, the optimality equation uses a $\\max$ operator. This signifies that an optimal agent will always choose the action $a$ that leads to the highest possible expected future return.\n*   The term inside the $\\max$ is the expected return if action $a$ is chosen, which includes the immediate reward $r$ and the discounted optimal value of the next state $V^*(s')$.\n\n#### Optimal Action-Value Function ($Q^*(s, a)$)\n\nThe optimal action-value function $Q^*(s, a)$ is the maximum action-value function over all policies:\n\n$$Q^*(s, a) = \\max_{\\pi} Q_{\\pi}(s, a)$$\n\nThe Bellman optimality equation for $Q^*(s, a)$ states that the value of an optimal state-action pair is the expected return from taking that action, followed by acting optimally thereafter:\n\n$$Q^*(s, a) = \\sum_{s' \\in \\mathcal{S}, r \\in \\mathcal{R}} p(s', r | s, a) [r + \\gamma \\max_{a' \\in \\mathcal{A}} Q^*(s', a')]$$\n\n**Explanation:**\n*   After taking action $a$ from state $s$, the environment transitions to $s'$ with reward $r$. From this new state $s'$, the agent then chooses the *optimal* action $a'$ (i.e., the one that maximizes the $Q$-value from $s'$), which is represented by $\\max_{a' \\in \\mathcal{A}} Q^*(s', a')$.\n*   This equation essentially says that the optimal value of taking action $a$ in state $s$ is the immediate reward plus the discounted optimal value of the best possible next action in the subsequent state.\n\nAlternatively, we can express the relationship between $V^*(s)$ and $Q^*(s, a)$ for optimal functions:\n\n$$V^*(s) = \\max_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} Q^*(s, a)$$\n\n$$Q^*(s, a) = \\sum_{s',r} p(s',r|s,a)[r + \\gamma V^*(s')]$$\n\n### Summary of Differences\n\n| Feature             | Bellman Expectation Equations                                 | Bellman Optimality Equations                                      |\n| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Purpose**         | Evaluate a **given policy** $\\pi$ (predicting returns if we follow $\\pi$). | Find the **optimal policy** $\\pi^*$ (yielding maximal returns).   |\n| **Action Selection**| Averages over actions weighted by the given policy $\\pi(a|s)$. | Uses a $\\max$ operator to select the best action.                  |\n| **Role of Policy**  | Policy $\\pi$ is explicitly part of the equation and determines action probabilities. | The optimal policy $\\pi^*$ is implicit; it's the policy that chooses the actions leading to the maximum value. |\n\nIn essence, the expectation equations help us understand how good a particular way of acting is, while the optimality equations tell us what the best possible way of acting is.","metadata":{"id":"4fbd7810"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"```markdown\n## Value Functions and Bellman Equations\n\nReinforcement Learning (RL) agents learn to make decisions by interacting with an environment.

Essentially, $V_{\\pi}(s)$ tells us \"how good\" it is to be in state $s$ when following policy $\\pi$.\n\nMathematically, the state-value function for a policy $\\pi$ is defined as:\n\n$$V_{\\pi}(s) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}[G_t | S_t = s]$$\n\nwhere:\n*   $G_t$ is the return (total discounted reward) from time $t$.\n*   $S_t = s$ means that the agent is in state $s$ at time $t$.\n*   $\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}[.]$ denotes the expected value given that the agent follows policy $\\pi$.\n*   The return $G_t$ is the sum of discounted future rewards: $G_t = R_{t+1} + \\gamma R_{t+2} + \\gamma^2 R_{t+3} + \\dots = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^k R_{t+k+1}$\n*   $\\gamma \\in [0, 1]$ is the discount factor, which determines the present value of future rewards. A $\\gamma$ close to 0 makes the agent short-sighted, while a $\\gamma$ close to 1 makes it long-sighted.\n\n### Action-Value Function ($Q_{\\pi}(s, a)$)\n\nThe **action-value function**, denoted as $Q_{\\pi}(s, a)$, represents the expected cumulative discounted reward an agent can expect to receive starting from state $s$, taking action $a$, and then following policy $\\pi$ thereafter. $Q_{\\pi}(s, a)$ tells us \"how good\" it is to take action $a$ in state $s$ when following policy $\\pi$.\n\nMathematically, the action-value function for a policy $\\pi$ is defined as:\n\n$$Q_{\\pi}(s, a) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}[G_t | S_t = s, A_t = a]$$\n\nwhere:\n*   $A_t = a$ means the agent takes action $a$ at time $t$.\n*   All other symbols are the same as defined for $V_{\\pi}(s)$.\n\n### Bellman Equations for Expectations\n\nThe Bellman equations express a fundamental property of value functions: they relate the value of a state (or state-action pair) to the values of successor states (or state-action pairs). These equations are recursive and form the basis for many RL algorithms.\n\n#### Bellman Expectation Equation for $V_{\\pi}(s)$\n\nThe state-value function $V_{\\pi}(s)$ can be decomposed into the immediate reward plus the discounted expected value of the next state:\n\n$$V_{\\pi}(s) = \\sum_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\pi(a|s) \\sum_{s' \\in \\mathcal{S}, r \\in \\mathcal{R}} p(s', r | s, a) [r + \\gamma V_{\\pi}(s')]$$\n\n**Explanation:**\n*   The outer sum iterates over all possible actions $a$ that can be taken from state $s$, weighted by their probabilities under policy $\\pi$ (i.e., $\\pi(a|s)$). This is because the agent follows policy $\\pi$ to choose an action.\n*   The inner sum iterates over all possible next states $s'$ and rewards $r$ that can result from taking action $a$ in state $s$, weighted by the transition probability $p(s', r | s, a)$.\n*   The term $[r + \\gamma V_{\\pi}(s')]$ represents the immediate reward $r$ obtained from the transition plus the discounted value of the next state $s'$, assuming we continue to follow policy $\\pi$.\n\nThis equation means that the value of a state $s$ is the expected sum of the immediate reward and the discounted value of the next state, averaged over all possible actions chosen by policy $\\pi$ and all possible next states and rewards generated by the environment.\n\n#### Bellman Expectation Equation for $Q_{\\pi}(s, a)$\n\nSimilarly, the action-value function $Q_{\\pi}(s, a)$ can be expressed recursively:\n\n$$Q_{\\pi}(s, a) = \\sum_{s' \\in \\mathcal{S}, r \\in \\mathcal{R}} p(s', r | s, a) [r + \\gamma \\sum_{a' \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\pi(a'|s') Q_{\\pi}(s', a')]$$\n\n**Explanation:**\n*   Starting in state $s$ and taking action $a$, the agent transitions to a next state $s'$ and receives reward $r$ with probability $p(s', r | s, a)$.\n*   From the next state $s'$, the agent then chooses an action $a'$ according to policy $\\pi$ (i.e., $\\pi(a'|s')$), leading to the action-value $Q_{\\pi}(s', a')$.\n*   The equation states that $Q_{\\pi}(s, a)$ is the expected immediate reward $r$ plus the discounted expected action-value of the next state-action pair $(s', a')$, averaged over all possible next states $s'$ and rewards $r$ given the current action $a$, and then over all possible next actions $a'$ chosen by policy $\\pi$.\n\nAlternatively, we can express $Q_{\\pi}(s,a)$ in terms of $V_{\\pi}(s')$:\n\n$$Q_{\\pi}(s, a) = \\sum_{s',r} p(s',r|s,a)[r + \\gamma V_{\\pi}(s')]$$\n\nAnd $V_{\\pi}(s)$ in terms of $Q_{\\pi}(s,a)$:\n\n$$V_{\\pi}(s) = \\sum_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\pi(a|s) Q_{\\pi}(s, a)$$\n\nThese two relationships allow us to move between state-value and action-value functions under a given policy.\n\n### Bellman Equations for Optimality\n\nWhile the expectation equations describe the value functions for a *given* policy $\\pi$, the **Bellman optimality equations** describe the value functions for the *optimal* policy, denoted as $\\pi^*$. The optimal policy is one that yields the maximum possible expected return from any state. The optimal value functions are denoted as $V^*(s)$ and $Q^*(s, a)$.\n\n#### Optimal State-Value Function ($V^*(s)$)\n\nThe optimal state-value function $V^*(s)$ is the maximum value function over all policies:\n\n$$V^*(s) = \\max_{\\pi} V_{\\pi}(s)$$\n\nThe Bellman optimality equation for $V^*(s)$ states that the value of an optimal state is the maximum over all actions of the expected return from taking that action:\n\n$$V^*(s) = \\max_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\sum_{s' \\in \\mathcal{S}, r \\in \\mathcal{R}} p(s', r | s, a) [r + \\gamma V^*(s')]$$\n\n**Explanation:**\n*   Unlike the expectation equation, which averages over actions according to a policy $\\pi(a|s)$, the optimality equation uses a $\\max$ operator. This signifies that an optimal agent will always choose the action $a$ that leads to the highest possible expected future return.\n*   The term inside the $\\max$ is the expected return if action $a$ is chosen, which includes the immediate reward $r$ and the discounted optimal value of the next state $V^*(s')$.\n\n#### Optimal Action-Value Function ($Q^*(s, a)$)\n\nThe optimal action-value function $Q^*(s, a)$ is the maximum action-value function over all policies:\n\n$$Q^*(s, a) = \\max_{\\pi} Q_{\\pi}(s, a)$$\n\nThe Bellman optimality equation for $Q^*(s, a)$ states that the value of an optimal state-action pair is the expected return from taking that action, followed by acting optimally thereafter:\n\n$$Q^*(s, a) = \\sum_{s' \\in \\mathcal{S}, r \\in \\mathcal{R}} p(s', r | s, a) [r + \\gamma \\max_{a' \\in \\mathcal{A}} Q^*(s', a')]$$\n\n**Explanation:**\n*   After taking action $a$ from state $s$, the environment transitions to $s'$ with reward $r$. From this new state $s'$, the agent then chooses the *optimal* action $a'$ (i.e., the one that maximizes the $Q$-value from $s'$), which is represented by $\\max_{a' \\in \\mathcal{A}} Q^*(s', a')$.\n*   This equation essentially says that the optimal value of taking action $a$ in state $s$ is the immediate reward plus the discounted optimal value of the best possible next action in the subsequent state.\n\nAlternatively, we can express the relationship between $V^*(s)$ and $Q^*(s, a)$ for optimal functions:\n\n$$V^*(s) = \\max_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} Q^*(s, a)$$\n\n$$Q^*(s, a) = \\sum_{s',r} p(s',r|s,a)[r + \\gamma V^*(s')]$$\n\n### Summary of Differences\n\n| Feature             | Bellman Expectation Equations                                 | Bellman Optimality Equations                                      |\n| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Purpose**         | Evaluate a **given policy** $\\pi$ (predicting returns if we follow $\\pi$). | Find the **optimal policy** $\\pi^*$ (yielding maximal returns).   |\n| **Action Selection**| Averages over actions weighted by the given policy $\\pi(a|s)$. | Uses a $\\max$ operator to select the best action.                  |\n| **Role of Policy**  | Policy $\\pi$ is explicitly part of the equation and determines action probabilities. | The optimal policy $\\pi^*$ is implicit; it's the policy that chooses the actions leading to the maximum value. |\n\nIn essence, the expectation equations help us understand how good a particular way of acting is, while the optimality equations tell us what the best possible way of acting is.","metadata":{"id":"76bc8de4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Dynamic Programming: Value and Policy Iteration\n\n### Subtask:\nImplement and demonstrate classic dynamic programming algorithms: Value Iteration and Policy Iteration, for solving small, known MDPs. Discuss their strengths and limitations.\n","metadata":{"id":"b85d86d5"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"```markdown\n### Dynamic Programming in Reinforcement Learning\n\nDynamic Programming (DP) refers to a collection of algorithms that can be used to compute optimal policies given a perfect model of the environment as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). DP methods are fundamental to Reinforcement Learning (RL) because they provide a powerful framework for planning. Unlike Monte Carlo methods or Temporal Difference learning, DP assumes full knowledge of the MDP's dynamics, i.e., the transition probabilities and reward function for all states and actions. This makes DP suitable for problems where the environment model is known.\n\nIn the context of RL, DP algorithms aim to find an optimal policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward. The core idea behind DP is to break down the problem into smaller, overlapping subproblems and solve each subproblem only once, storing the results to avoid redundant computations. This is achieved by using Bellman equations, which express the value of a state or state-action pair in terms of the values of successor states.\n\nThe two primary DP algorithms for solving MDPs are **Value Iteration** and **Policy Iteration**. Both aim to find an optimal policy, but they approach the problem in slightly different ways.\n```","metadata":{"id":"907cc622"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"```markdown\n### Policy Iteration\n\nPolicy Iteration is an iterative algorithm that finds the optimal policy for a given MDP by alternating between two main steps: **Policy Evaluation** and **Policy Improvement**. It guarantees to converge to an optimal policy in a finite number of steps for finite MDPs.\n\n#### 1. Policy Evaluation\n\nIn this phase, for a given policy $\\pi$, we compute the state-value function $V_\\pi(s)$, which represents the expected return when starting in state $s$ and following policy $\\pi$ thereafter. This is done by solving the Bellman expectation equation for $V_\\pi(s)$:\n\n$$V_\\pi(s) = \\sum_a \\pi(a|s) \\sum_{s', r} p(s', r|s, a) [r + \\gamma V_\\pi(s')]$$\n\nSince this is a system of linear equations, it can be solved directly for small MDPs. However, for larger MDPs, an iterative approach is typically used. This involves repeatedly updating the value function until it converges:\n\n$$V_{k+1}(s) = \\sum_a \\pi(a|s) \\sum_{s', r} p(s', r|s, a) [r + \\gamma V_k(s')]$$\n\nThe iteration stops when the change in $V_\\pi(s)$ between successive iterations is smaller than a predefined threshold $\\theta$, indicating convergence.\n\n#### 2. Policy Improvement\n\nOnce the policy evaluation step has converged and we have an accurate $V_\\pi(s)$ for the current policy $\\pi$, we then improve the policy. This involves selecting actions that maximize the expected future reward from each state, assuming we follow the current value function $V_\\pi(s)$. The new policy $\\pi'$ is greedy with respect to $V_\\pi$:\n\n$$\\pi'(s) = \\arg\\max_a \\sum_{s', r} p(s', r|s, a) [r + \\gamma V_\\pi(s')]$$\n\nIf the new policy $\\pi'$ is better than or equal to the previous policy $\\pi$ for all states, then the algorithm has converged to an optimal policy. If not, the new policy $\\pi'$ becomes the current policy, and the process reiterates with a new policy evaluation phase.\n\n**Convergence:** Policy Iteration is guaranteed to converge to an optimal policy and optimal value function in a finite number of iterations for finite MDPs. This is because there are a finite number of policies, and policy improvement guarantees that each new policy is either strictly better than or equal to the previous one. If it's equal, then an optimal policy has been found.\n```","metadata":{"id":"57a0c19e"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"```markdown\n### Value Iteration\n\nValue Iteration is another iterative algorithm for finding an optimal policy. Unlike Policy Iteration, which alternates between evaluating and improving a policy, Value Iteration directly computes the optimal state-value function $V^*(s)$ by iteratively applying the Bellman Optimality Equation. Once $V^*(s)$ is found, the optimal policy $\\pi^*(s)$ can be easily derived.\n\n#### 1. Iterative Update of Value Function\n\nThe core of Value Iteration is the iterative application of the Bellman Optimality Equation for the state-value function:\n\n$$V_{k+1}(s) = \\max_a \\sum_{s', r} p(s', r|s, a) [r + \\gamma V_k(s')]$$\n\nThis equation states that the value of a state $s$ at iteration $k+1$ is the maximum expected reward achievable by taking any action $a$ from state $s$, considering the immediate reward $r$ and the discounted value of the next state $s'$ according to the value function from iteration $k$. The iteration starts with an arbitrary value function (e.g., all zeros) and continues until the value function converges.\n\nConvergence is typically determined by checking if the maximum change in any state's value between successive iterations is smaller than a small threshold $\\theta$ (e.g., $||V_{k+1} - V_k||_\\infty < \\theta$). This indicates that the value function has stabilized and is close to the optimal value function $V^*(s)$.\n\n#### 2. Extracting the Optimal Policy\n\nOnce the optimal value function $V^*(s)$ has been found, the optimal policy $\\pi^*(s)$ can be directly extracted. For each state $s$, the optimal policy chooses the action $a$ that maximizes the expected return, using the converged optimal value function $V^*(s')$ for the successor states:\n\n$$\\pi^*(s) = \\arg\\max_a \\sum_{s', r} p(s', r|s, a) [r + \\gamma V^*(s')]$$\n\nThis means that once we know the optimal values of all states, we can simply perform a one-step lookahead from each state to find the best action.\n\n**Convergence:** Value Iteration is guaranteed to converge to the optimal value function $V^*(s)$ and an optimal policy for finite MDPs. This is because the Bellman Optimality operator is a contraction mapping, ensuring that repeated application will eventually converge to a unique fixed point, which is $V^*(s)$.\n```","metadata":{"id":"cfdb51af"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Reasoning**:\nThe next step is to set up a small, discrete MDP environment in code, as per the instructions.

Introduce the idea of **Generalized Policy Iteration (GPI)** in the context of MC, highlighting **Monte Carlo ES (Exploring Starts)** as a method for ensuring all state-action pairs are visited. Discuss the importance of **exploration** strategies, such as $\\epsilon$-greedy policies, to ensure continued learning and to avoid getting stuck in sub-optimal solutions.

Explain the architecture and interaction between the 'actor' (policy) and the 'critic' (value function).\n\n1.  **Core Idea of Actor-Critic**: Explain that AC agents consist of two main components:\n    *   **Actor**: A neural network or parameterized function that learns the policy $\\pi_{\\theta}(a|s)$ and is responsible for selecting actions.\n    *   **Critic**: A neural network or parameterized function that learns the value function (e.g., $V_{\\phi}(s)$ or $Q_{\\phi}(s,a)$) and is responsible for evaluating the actions taken by the actor.\n2.  **Interaction and Learning**: Describe how the critic provides an estimate of the advantage function or TD error, which is then used by the actor to update its policy parameters. This allows the actor to update its policy more frequently (after each step) and with lower variance than pure Monte Carlo policy gradient methods. Explain how both the actor and critic are trained simultaneously.\n3.  **Basic Actor-Critic Algorithm (e.g., A2C)**: Detail the general structure of a basic AC algorithm. Explain how the critic learns the value function by minimizing the TD error (or a similar objective), and how the actor learns the policy by maximizing the expected return using the critic's value estimates to guide its updates. Discuss the role of the TD error as a 'direction' or 'surprise' signal for the actor.\n4.  **Benefits and Challenges**: Discuss the advantages of AC methods, such as their ability to handle continuous action spaces, their generally lower variance compared to REINFORCE, and their efficiency (online learning).
